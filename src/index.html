          is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz,<br> 
          Bayonne<br>
          or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona<br>
          partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St.<br> 
          Sebastian<br> 
          partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurt<br> 
          partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches<br>
          partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary<br>
          it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still<br> 
          as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it<br> 
          in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth<br>
          between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles<br>

          and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint<br>
          you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them<br>
          I look<br>
          at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world<br>
          except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick<br>
          which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together the first<br> 
          time<br>
          and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism<br>
          just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or<br>
          at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow<br> 
          me<br>
          and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them<br>
          when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun<br> 
          sank<br>
          or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully<br>
          as the horse<br>
          it seems they were all cheated of some marvellous experience<br>
          which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I’m telling you about it<br>
